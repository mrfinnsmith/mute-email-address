# What this is
Do you get a lot of unsolicited emails from salespeople? This project allows you to permanently "mute" any new emails you get from a person just by applying a label to one of their emails.

# How to use
1. Paste it into a new Google Apps Script project.
1. Run it at least once to grant it permission to access your email.
1. Set a trigger to run as frequently as you want.
1. Done. Now when you apply the label "mute-this" to an email, the project will add the sender to a filter that filters out al their future emails.
